# Epidemics-Toolset

The Covid-19 pandemic has shown us that access to quick,
reliable results about viruses and possible outbreaks is essential. As
such, my project "The Epidemics Toolset" aims to aid researchers and
laypersons in discovering information about an unknown virus. The goal
is to provide an interactive tool to both analyse an unknown virus
genome and predict the evolution of an infectious disease. The user
can upload a .fasta file with two virus genomes, a known one and an
unknown one, for which the web app computes relevant elements such as
the similarity percentage and the GC content. Moreover, it calculates
and graphs the possible spread of the infectious disease through
mathematical models such as the SIR and SEIR. The web app was designed
in Anvil using Python and integrating Google Colaboratory code.
